##Problem 1

```{r problem 1}
random_sample<-rnorm(10)
###a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
logical_vector<-random_sample>0
##a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
char_vector<-rep("10",10)
##a character vector of length 10
factor_vector<-c("1","2","3","1","2","3","1","2","3","1")
factor_vector<-as.factor(factor_vector)
##a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
dataFrame_problem1<-data.frame(random_sample,logical_vector,char_vector,factor_vector)
##take the mean of a variable in a dataframe
library(tidyverse)
mean(pull(dataFrame_problem1,1))
##numeric can get mean
mean(pull(dataFrame_problem1,2))
##logical can get mean
mean(pull(dataFrame_problem1,3))
mean(as.numeric(pull(dataFrame_problem1,3)))
##char cannot get mean
mean(pull(dataFrame_problem1,4))
mean(as.numeric(pull(dataFrame_problem1,4)))
##char cannot get mean
